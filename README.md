# Surfs Up Analysis

## Project Overview
W. Avy wants to know whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round based on temperature trends for the months of June and December.

1. Query all temperatures for the months of June and December.
2. Convert the temperatures to a list.
3. Create a DataFrame.
4. Generate summary statistics.

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
The analysis of the summary statistics show that:
- There is a three degree difference in the mean temperature for the months of June and December.
- December has a higher range in temperatures than June with December having a range of 27 and June with a range of 21.
- The standard deviation for December is approximately 0.5 degrees higher than June.

## Challenge Overview
This analysis was challenging in that it forced me to look up many things such as using the extract function in the query and to be careful with syntax within the query.

## Challenge Summary
Two additional queries should be done to find out whether or not it is a viable option to have the shop open year-round. The first query would be to find how often it rains and the second would be to find out a more detailed temperature finding based on the stations in the surrounding area where the shop will be located.
